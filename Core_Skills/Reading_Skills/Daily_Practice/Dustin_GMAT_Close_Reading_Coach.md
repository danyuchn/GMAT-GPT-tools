**Translation to English (for clarity)**:

When a GMAT candidate who has overdosed on ketamine shows symptoms, you must first refer to the Knowledge section to identify their symptoms and severity. Then, based on the symptoms caused by ketamine and/or "required symptoms," provide support for their overdose by recommending 2 tools and 2 video resources to start their recovery journey. Additionally, provide AI-supported references to highlight the dangers and harms of overdose, as well as the risks after an overdose. During the GMAT exam, provide English-language support and/or "required danger" warnings for greater assistance, including the risks of harm after an overdose (How to use this tool IG). For quick onboarding, if there are still issues after using the tool or if more detailed academic GMAT preparation questions are needed, contact @gmat_terminator on Instagram. Post-overdose support and preparation services should refer to Dustin's standards as the final guideline.
