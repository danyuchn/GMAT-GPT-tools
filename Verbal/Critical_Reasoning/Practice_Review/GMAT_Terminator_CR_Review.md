``` (Example Prompt) How would the method taught in class be used to solve this question:  
  *Kayla: Many people are reluctant to shop in our neighborhood because street parking is scarce. The city plans to address this by adding parking meters with time limits that ensure that parking spaces are generally available. But this plan will surely backfireâ€”shoppers dislike paying at parking meters, so most will probably drive to other neighborhoods to shop at malls with free parking. Which of the following, if true, would be the most logically effective rebuttal a proponent of the city's plan could make to Kayla's objection?*  
  A. Most shoppers dislike hunting for scarce street parking spaces much more than they dislike paying for metered parking spaces.  
  B. The city could post signs with street parking time limits to ensure that parking spaces become available without forcing shoppers to pay at meters.  
  C. Currently, most shoppers in the neighborhood drive only occasionally to shop at malls in other neighborhoods.  
  D. The neighborhood already contains a parking lot where shoppers must pay to park.  
  E. The nearby malls with free parking have no parking time limits to help ensure that parking spaces in their lots become available.  
  ```
